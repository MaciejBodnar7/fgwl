FireGem Watchlist is a web application that allows users to search for movies, add them to their watchlist, and view their watchlist later. It utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Search Page**: The index.html page serves as the search page. Users can search for movies by title, and the application makes calls to the OMDB API to retrieve and display search results.
- **Add to Watchlist**: Users can add movies from the search results to their watchlist by clicking the "Add to Watchlist" button. The movie data is then saved to the local storage.

- **Watchlist Page**: The watchlist.html page loads and displays the movies saved in the user's watchlist from local storage.
